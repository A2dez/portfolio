    "text": "Introduction\nThe property price index is a valuable resource which lists the price of every property sold since 2010 in (the twenty-six counties of) Ireland, but unfortunately, the database was designed by people who ‘know the price of everything but the value of nothing’. Allegedly, the data has been uploaded one entry at a time, by solicitors’ secretaries, many of whom express their humanity through misspelling and irregular punctuation, while several express their Irishness with the cúpla focail. This valuable dataset is thus a bit like being given a big five-bed house for a free holiday but having to wade through the previous tenants’ filth.\nMy role here is to take this unkempt raw data and flip it, scrubbing it goodo, and presenting it back to you, the reader, as an inhabitable space which, I hope, you can explore with some pleasure."

    "text": "What is contained in the data?\nEach row in the dataset represents the sale of a single property. The sale date is included along with the sale price and the address. It is thus possible to see how much your neighbours paid for their gaff or indeed any property sold in Ireland since 2010. There is a useful column for the county and eircodes have been added to the data in recent years. There is some secondary data about the nature of the sale, such as whether the property was sold at the market price or not, whether VAT was charged, whether the house was new or second-hand. A column is included for the size of the property, roughly equating to tiny (&lt;38sq. m), large (&gt; 125 sq.m) or anything in-between.\nThe very first thing to do is to clean the column names which were either designed for humans to read on a spreadsheet, or, perhaps more likely, conceived as a set of instructions for those entering sale details into the database. I want them in a format suitable for coding in R. No capitals, spaces or excess descriptive baggage. First off, I will work create a copy of the property_raw dataframe so that I can start again every time I make an error, without having to read in the data again.\n\n\n[1] \"Date of Sale (dd/mm/yyyy)\" \"Address\"                  \n[3] \"County\"                    \"Eircode\"                  \n[5] \"Price (\\u0080)\"            \"Not Full Market Price\"    \n[7] \"VAT Exclusive\"             \"Description of Property\"  \n[9] \"Property Size Description\"\n\n\nLet’s look at each column in turn, and, in doing so, I will clean them up, before plotting the cleaner version of the data. The date needs to be convered back to a data form, the year is essential, and I’m including quarter, month and day (of the week) because we might find them useful later, and it might just be interesting to see which days and months are the most common for sales and which are the most expensive.\n\nDates and sales\nSo the simplest thing to look at is how many properties have been sold each year since they started collecting the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s pretty clear that there’s a massive difference between the recession of 2010-13 and the sudden return to form in 2014, followed by five more years of increased sales before Covid. Unsurprisingly, sales dropped in 2020, but they didn’t nosedive like, say, the airline industry, and 2021 shows a return to 2019 levels.\nAt the time of writing (November 2022), it is not immediately obvious if sales will increase from 2021, but, if we break down sales by month, as in the plot below, then that seems likely, as each month has been consistently a wee bit ahead thus far. This resolution makes it possible to see inside the grim years of the Covid pandemic. Understandably there were reduced sales in April 2020 (2647 sales vs 4562 in 2019), May (2592 v 4940), June (3083 v 4356), but things re-normalized by October (5576 v 5579) and November (5379 v 5264), while the end-of-year rush in the ‘meaningful’ month of December 2020 (7474 sales) was a good deal larger than December 2019 (6798).\n\n\n\n\nProperties sold by year\n\n\nOne last thing to note, before I get too far into the weeds, is that there hasn’t been a bounceback from the “missing” 10,000 sales in 2020. Instead, the 2021 and 2022 sales totals look like a natural progression from the years leading up to 2020.\nIt’s also worth a quick sconce at quarterly data in recent years. I’ve kept 2019 as a control group, and its numbers are similar to 2021 (12-14-16-18k versus 13-13-15-18k), while 2022 is looking similar at the time of writing (13-15-16k). Only 2020 shows a notable slump, with a massive drop in Q2 and only partial recovery in Q3r. Yet Q4 2020 shows identical numbers to 2019 and 2021 (18k apiece). However, what we might see is a differential in sales of new and second-hand homes as construction of new houses stopped for long periods due to Covid, whereas second-hand houses-to-be already basically existed.\n\n\nNew homes versus old\nBefore we look at the frightening cost of a gaff in this country, I’m going to clean up the “Property Description” column, which is the one that tells you if the gaff is new or old. This will give us an introduction to the absolute state of this dataset:\n\n\n                                  group  count\n1 Second-Hand Dwelling house /Apartment 609317\n2         New Dwelling house /Apartment 127141\n3        Teach/Árasán Cónaithe Atháimhe     44\n4             Teach/Árasán Cónaithe Nua      3\n5             Teach/?ras?n C?naithe Nua      1\n\n\nThe label ‘New Dwelling house /Apartment’ is not computer-friendly and I’ll change it to ‘New’ (with a cheeky capital because it’ll save me manually relabelling axes later at little cos). Similarly, ‘Second-Hand Dwelling house /Apartment’ will become ‘Old’ an underdescriptive label that at least contrasts nicely against ‘New’. Mar sin féin, new_or_old$count[3:nrow(new_or_old)] %&gt;% sum properties have had their description listed in Irish, so we need to clean those up, and basically translate them back into English. There have been some issues importing the fadas (accents) but we can still group them using ad-hoc regexes.\n\n\n  group  count percentage\n1   Old 609361      82.74\n2   New 127145      17.26\n\n\nIt is not yet the time to concern ourselves with the fact that only new_or_old_cleaned$count[2] new properties ((100*new_or_old_cleaned$count[2]/nrow(property)) %&gt;% round(1) %&gt;% paste0(.,'%') of them) have been sold in a country which has grown by just over half a million people since 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEircodes\nRecent years have contained eircode data which is a great addition, but unfortunately that column has been added at the expense of an postcode column which, while sparsely populated and confined solely to Dublin, will remain a useful bit of data when we are trying to find which towns and villages belong in which part of Dublin.\nBefore we examine eircode data, we need to convert the ‘date’ column from a string to an actual date variable, and also extract the months, weeks, day and day of the week, as this may be valuable data for modelling later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse prices by county"

    "title": "Words ending in -th",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Among the many curiosities of English is the survival of a “-th” affix, pronounced /𝜃/. There are two main groups of these. The first is for ordinal numbers, and there’s as many of these as there are numbers, as in the fourth, the fifth and the sixth of something, the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, the hundredth, thousandth, millionth, billionth, squillionth. And of course the nth number, the umpteenth example and last but not necessarily least, the zeroth case. This affix is productive so if someone thinks up a new number – such as i – then we can have the i-th case. No doubt someone has ound reason to talk of the minus-fourth caseor even the minus-oneth.\nHowandever, the focus here will be on the other group of -th words, a bunch of survivors from Old English, before the Sasanaigh sold out to the ruling French and the ecclesiastial Latins and the unputdownable Greeks. The -th suffix often shows up in abstract nouns used for measurement. What is the volume of a cube? The length by the breadth by the width. Or is it the length by the depth by the height? Yet there are several more. Health, wealth, strength, warmth, growth, sloth, month, truth, filth, worth, dearth and even birth and death.\nThese abstract nouns mostly derive from an adjective which, nowadays, may be rather different, in either its spelling, sound or both. My goal here is to unveil these curious patterns, although some cases may require a little background.\nThis lot are closely related:\n\nDepth comes from Deep\nhealth comes from heal\nwealth comes from weal (well)\ndearth comes from dear\n\nIn Middle English, vowels could be long or short, and the short form would be triggered when multiple consonants followed. Thus deep had a long [e:] sound but depth had a short [e]. Almost the same as dape – depth, dape – depth. Same vowel quality but different length. During the Great Vowel Shift, long vowels changed their quality, so that [a:] became [e:], [e:] became [i:] and [i:] diphthongized to [aI]. This is why non-English-speaking Europeans frequently confuse A with E and E with I.\nOne reflex of this in modern spelling is that we distinguish &lt;ee&gt; from &lt;e&gt; in some contexts, but not all, as in serene, serenity or the unrelated Venus, venture.\nLength variation still occurs in modern English although it occurs below most people’s level of perception. My name is ‘Des’ with a long vowel, but my full name ‘Desmond’ is short. Des. Desmond, Des, Desmond. The longer vowel only occurs before voiced consonants, or no consonant. Thus Des, which has a /z/ sound, is longer than Jess which has /s/. This distinction vanishes when there are more syllables, hence the short vowel of Desmond and Dessie.\n\nAdding [𝜃] triggered the short version.\n\nBack to -th words and we see a vowel variation in the following cases:\n\nwide - width\nfive - fifth\nMoon - month\n\nThe alternation does not occur when the base adjective ends in a vowel sound, as in\n\ngrow - growth\ntrue - truth or in the historical pronunciation of\nslow - sloth.\n\nThis is because you needed two consonants in a cluster to trigger the shortening of a vowel. Yet if the base form had two consonants, then it couldn’t lengthen, as in\n\nwarm - warmth\n\nAnd perhaps:\n\nmerry - mirth\n\nOther examples show an unrelated process called vowel mutation, which is a topic for another day.\n\nLong – length\nStrong – strength\nBroad – breadth\nfoul – filth\nbear – birth\ndie – death\n\nFinally, you may be wondering what of the words first, second and third cases. Are these just bastardized cases of -th, as they all end in a dental stop. Alas, no. first contains a form of the -est suffix for superlatives. Second comes from Latin secundus, although the Englishword used to be other, surviving in the (mostly American) phrase, every other day. As for third, I’m not sure, but my guess is that it is related. The OE form was thridda and may have been formed in continental Germanic before the -th suffix became distinct to the Insular Anglo-Saxon in Britain."
